    "Aim is to classify a firm’s credit rating into one of the 16 categories and to predict whether a firm is considered investment grade or not. To do so dataset is split into two set as 80% training set and 20% testing set. Two methodology is being followed, first one is by creating dummy variables and adding it to dataset and second one is without using dummy variables. Last column denotes the rating, while the second-to-last column denotes Investment grade value. ‘1’ indicates assets are of investment grade and ‘0’ indicates they are not."

In every modelling process two parameters are selected as input features (input variables) and target variable (output variable). From the data set and aim of modelling, it is obvious to select input features other than last two columns of dataset (InvGrd&Rating). And Target variable will be “InvGrd” column, because classification is based on “0’s” and “1’s” of InvGrd column values. Data is split into two sets using train_test_split() function. Function random_state is used to split the data in similar random way every time program runs. Later training and testing data is computed using iloc[] function .\n",

    "Initially data is pre-processed by scaling input features to improve performance of model. Later mean and standard deviation of data is calculated and stored. This statistics data is used while scaling. Model approaches sequential architecture. By iteratively modifying the weights and biases during the training phase, dense layers are utilised to learn complicated patterns and representations from the input data. An activation function is used to calculate the dense layer's output, adding non-linearity to the model and enabling the discovery of non-linear correlations in the data. Rectified linear unit is used as activation function to reduce the vanishing gradient problem. Sequential layers are chosen mainly because information is flowing in one direction, from input to output. Dense () tells that neurons are interconnected. At the end sigmoid activation is used for binary classification. Optimizer = ‘adam’ , Adam algorithm is used as it automatically adjusts the learning rate for each parameter compared to fixed learning rate methods. As binary classification is performed to achieve classification in this model, binary_crossentropy is used to calculate loss between two predicted outputs. ‘accuracy’ is a list containing the accuracy metric, which measures the amount of correctly predicted samples out of total samples.\n",

During the begining of analysis every model had accuracy around 0.75 to 0.77.But when the parameters such that penalty, alpha , solver and random_state is changed , accuracy above 80 was achievable. So it means that parameters affect in different way for different types of dataset.Hence parameters must be selected as per data set requirement after proper analysis of data , accuracy and all other factors."
